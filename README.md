## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use this attribute that controls the z axis and orders the position of an element on the axis. 
```css
  z-index: 1;
```

I learned this attribute that allow to insert other characteriscs to the tag.
```css
&:before {
  content: " ";
}
```

In this project I learned to developed a full page 'Meet landing' wich included a responsive configuration for tablet and mobile.
